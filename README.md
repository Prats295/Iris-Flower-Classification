🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project
A beginner-friendly Machine Learning project to classify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements using Python and Scikit-Learn.

📌 Project Overview

This project implements supervised classification on the Iris dataset to predict species:
Iris-setosa
Iris-versicolor
Iris-virginica

It covers the end-to-end ML pipeline: ✅ Data Loading
✅ Data Preprocessing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Model Building and Training
✅ Evaluation using metrics and visualizations

🛠️ Tools and Libraries

Python
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

📊 Dataset

Standard Iris dataset containing:
Sepal Length & Width
Petal Length & Width
Species (target)


🚀 Features Implemented

✅ Data cleaning and handling missing values
✅ Label encoding (if required)
✅ Data visualization using scatter plots, pair plots, heatmaps
✅ Data normalization/standardization
✅ Model training using:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Trees
Random Forest


✅ Evaluation using:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix


✅ PCA for 2D visualization of clusters
✅ Hyperparameter tuning (k in KNN, max_depth in Decision Trees)

📈 Results

The models demonstrated good accuracy on test data while visualizations provided clear insights into feature importance and class separability.
